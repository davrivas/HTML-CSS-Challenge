            Nobody’s born <em>smart.</em> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do <em>algebra</em>.<br>
            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
            There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
            And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his <em>ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
            Thankfully, we are born to <em>learn.</em><br>
            Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
            Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
            Until one day, you walk.<br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <em>stronger.</em><br>
            Failing is just another word for <em>growing.</em> And you keep going.<br>
            This. is. <em>learning.</em><br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
            You just don’t get it, yet.
            Because the most <em>beautiful,</em> complex concepts in the whole <em>universe</em><br>
            are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can <em>understand.</em><br>
            Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            You only have to know one thing:<br>
            <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
